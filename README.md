## 🤔 About 
Line Breaker is an Xcode source editor extension that helps format your code by breaking up long lines into multiple lines, and doing so with correct indentation.  It can be used to break up a variety of different types of long lines of code that can plague readability in projects such as:
* Function definitions
* `if let` statments
* `guard let` statements
* Chained function calls
* Array declarations
* Dictionary declarations
